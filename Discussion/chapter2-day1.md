## Self study/Discussion

* Check out William Pughâ€™s [Java memory model](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/) website.
* Acquaint yourself with the [JSR 133 (Java memory model) FAQ.](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/jsr-133-faq.html)
  
* What guarantees does the Java memory model make regarding initializa-
tion safety?
* Is it always necessary to use locks to safely publish objects between threads?
* What is the double-checked locking anti-pattern? Why is it an anti-pattern?
