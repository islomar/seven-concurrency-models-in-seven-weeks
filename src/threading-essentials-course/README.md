# Threading essentials course
Author: Heinz Kabutz

## Concurrency vs Parallelism
* **Concurrency**
    * it's about dealing with lots of things at once.
    * example of the bus o waiting at the airport.
* **Parallelism**
    * it's about doing lots of things at once.
    * you usually don't use threads.


## new Thread(), ExecutorService, ForkJoinPool, Parallel Streams
* Parallel is not always faster, it depends on the input (example with already sorted array of integers).
* Thread and ExecutorService: more about concurrency.
* ForkJoinPool and Parallel Streams: more about parallelism.
